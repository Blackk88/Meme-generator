This small app allows to get random image and create meme with your own text. 
This funny application allowed me to learn more about basics of React, as well as learn a lot of new features. Following through this tutorial I studied about controlled components in React, practiced with API request in React using useEffect Hook and how to properly update State using spread operator and much more.
